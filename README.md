# PROJECT---LIVE-CRICKET-SCOREBOARD
This is a full-stack web application that provides real-time cricket match scores, player statistics, and match details in a clean, user-friendly interface. Built with a modern tech stack, the project fetches live data from external cricket APIs and dynamically updates the scoreboard without needing manual refresh.
